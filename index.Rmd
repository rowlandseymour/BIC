## Module Aims

Bayesian inference is a set of methods where the probability of an event
occurring can be updated as more information becomes available. It is
fundamentally different from frequentist methods, which are based on
long running relative frequencies. This module gives an introduction to
the Bayesian approach to statistical analysis and the theory that
underpins it.

Students will be able to explain the distinctive features of Bayesian
methodology, understand and appreciate the role of prior distributions
and compute posterior distributions. It will cover the derivation of
posterior distributions, the construction of prior distributions, and
inference for missing data. Extensions are considered to models with
more than a single parameter and how these can be used to analyse data.
Computational methods have greatly advanced the use of Bayesian methods
and this module covers, and allows students to apply, procedures for the
sampling and analysis of intractable Bayesian problems.

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1.  Demonstrate a full and rigorous understanding of all definitions
    associated with Bayesian inference and understand the differences
    between the Bayesian and frequentist approaches to inference
2.  Demonstrate a sound understanding of the fundamental concepts of
    Bayesian inference and computational sampling methods
3.  Understand how to make inferences assuming various population
    distributions while taking into account expert opinion and the
    implications of weak prior knowledge and large samples
4.  Demonstrate an understanding of the principles of Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo and be able to programme an MCMC algorithm
5.  Engage in Bayesian data analysis in diverse situations drawn from
    physics, biological, engineering and other mathematical contexts.

## Module Structure

The module is split between theory and computation. Each week will have three lectures, one computer lab and one problem class. In the labs, you will need to bring your own laptop. The timetable for this module is

| Day       | Time | Room    | Type         |
|-----------|------|---------|--------------|
| Monday    | 1200 | Physics West 115 | Lecture      |
| Tuesday   | 1000 | Nuffield G18 | Computer Lab |
| Thursday | 1100 | Strathcona SR8 | Lecture      |
| Thursday | 1200 | Strathcona SR8 | Guided Study   |
| Friday    | 1200 | Muirhead 122 | Lecture |

## Assessment

Assessment for this module is 50% via an exam and 50% via coursework
assignments during the semester. The exam will last 1h 30m and take
place during the summer exam period. There will be three coursework
assignment -- assignment 1 will be worth 10% of the final mark, with
assignments 2 and 3 counting for 20% each. More details about the
assignments will be made available during the semester.

## Getting Help

There are lots of ways of getting help throughout the module. You can
visit my office hour (Watson 317) on Wednesdays at 0900-1030 or email me at

## Recommended Books and Videos

No books are required for this course and the whole material is
contained in these notes. However, you may find it useful to use other
resources in your studies. I recommend the following:

1.  [A First Course in Bayesian Statistical Methods - Peter D.
    Hoff](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-92407-6).
    This is a short book that covers the basics of Bayesian inference
    and computation. To the point and well written, it's a useful place
    to look topics up.

2.  [Bayesian Data Analysis - Andrew Gelman, John Carlin, Hal Stern,
    David Dunson, Aki Vehtari, and Donald
    Rubin](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). This is a
    thorough book explaining everything you'd need to know to carry out
    Bayesian data analysis. It's a fairly long and in-depth book, but
    the authors are authoritative and give good advice throughout.
    Example code on the website is in R, Python and Stan.

3.  [Statistical Rethinking - Richard
    McElrath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/). This book
    provides a friendly intuitive understanding of Bayesian inference
    and computation. Aimed at social and natural scientists, it has less
    theory that the other two books but is perhaps more approachable. A
    set of video lectures for this book can be found on
    [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN).

## Common Distributions

For many Bayesian inference problems, it is useful to be able to
identify probability density functions (for continuous random variables)
and probability mass functions (for discrete random variables) up to
proportionality. Some common density/mass functions are given below.

**Normal distribution** $$
\pi(x \mid \mu, \sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x-\mu)^2\right\} \qquad x \in\mathbb{R},
$$ where $\mu \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\sigma > 0$.

**Beta distribution** $$
\pi(x\mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha, \beta)}x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta - 1} \qquad  x \in [0, 1],
$$ where $\alpha, \beta > 0$ and $B(\alpha, \beta)$ is the [beta
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function).

**Gamma distribution** $$
\pi(x\mid \alpha, \beta) = \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}x^{\alpha - 1}e^{-\beta x} \qquad  x > 0,
$$ where $\alpha, \beta > 0$ and $\Gamma(\alpha)$ is the [gamma
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function).

**Exponential distribution** $$
f(x \mid \lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} \qquad x > 0,
$$ where $\lambda > 0$.

**Poisson distribution** $$
\pi(x = k \mid \lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \qquad k \in \{1, 2, \ldots\},
$$ where $\lambda > 0$.

**Binomial distribution** $$
\pi(x = k \mid N, p) = \begin{pmatrix} N \\ k\end{pmatrix} p^k (1-p)^{N-k} \qquad k \in \{1, \ldots, N\}
$$ where $p \in [0, 1]$.
